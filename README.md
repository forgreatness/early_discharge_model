# Purpose
The goal of this project is to improve hospital care efficiency by reducing the cost of early discharge. 

## Hypothesis
By using EMR data from the hospital that details how a patient is treated per encounter, we can train a model that will help average the length of stay for a specific encounter. Helping the hospital be able to plan for additional resources. 

## Resources / Existing Research
_Research Articles_
* [Early Warning Discharge Disposition Tool](https://www.ajmc.com/view/an-early-warning-tool-for-predicting-at-admission-the-discharge-disposition-of-a-hospitalized-patient) A tool design to predict patient discharge disposition at the time of admission
* [Expected Discharge Date Accuracy](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10916-023-01952-1)
This research article evaluates the accuracy of early expected discharge date within first 24hours of admission

_Code Implementation_
* [Early Readmission Prediction Model](https://github.com/AnthonyByansi/EarlyReadmission-Prediction-ERP-Model)
A model that predicts the probability the patient will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge
* [Predicting Hospital Readmisison](https://github.com/laurenemilyto/predicting-hospital-readmission)
A model that predicts whether a diabetes cased will be readmitted
* [Predicting Early Hospital Readmission](https://github.com/Jack-Etheredge/Predicting-early-hospital-readmissions?tab=readme-ov-file)
A model that is more extensively tested to predict a patience has be early discharge
